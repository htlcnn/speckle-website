# Expected Client behaviour

Clients should have the following behaviour

## Definitions

Native Application: an editing application that will receive SpeckleStream info (e.g. Revit, Rhino, etc...)

Client: a plugin to a native application that communicates with the SpeckleServer

Element: an individual Speckle object (e.g. a surfage, a wall, a beam, etc...)

## General


* Client must allow end users to choose a speckle server to connect to, and provide a means for the users to authenticate with the server.
* Clients should persist server information in a secure way in the file (do not assume the file is a safe storage area!)
* Clients should be able to create new streams and specify the project that they stream belongs to.


## Sending

* Initial send is easy: send it all! The client may provide a means for the user to select certain elements to send, or provide a filter to only send matching elements.
* On subsequent sends, the client should only send added, modified or removed elements to the speckle server. (Note that this
  behaviour is taken care of by SpeckleCore, and the client developer should not have to worry about it.)
* When a sender is first set up, get a new stream ID from the speckle server. Store the server and stream id for subsequent sessions.
* If a file has a stream id stored in it, the client should check that the current user is the owner of that stream or has permissions to write. If the current user does not have permission to write to the stream, the client should offer to create a new stream.
* Each Speckle element sent should have the application_id set. If an element in the 
  native application has a specified speckle application_id, it must be preserved on send. 
  If the object has no tagged application id, the sending client can assign one.
* Create a version of the stream on each manual send. If the client is continuously sending changes
  the server will periodically freeze changes without any client intervention.
* When sending manually to a stream, the client should allow the user to add a descriptive status message.


## Receiving


* The client must tag all objects it creates with the stream ID that it came from and the element application_id.
  These tags must be persistent in the native application file and persist across file closing and openings. 
* The client must keep track of what server each stream is from.
* The client is responsible for keeping the elements in the application in sync with each update to the stream.
* When an incoming object already exists in the native application (as determined by a matching application_id), 
  the client should whenever possible update the objectâ€™s properties - *not* delete and recreate the object. 
  This is to preserve any changes made downstream in the native application to properties not set by the incoming speckle stream. 
* When an object is deleted from a speckle stream, the client must delete that object from the application
* The client should only modify the objects it has created.
* The client may provide an option for the user to specify that only certain properties of the elements be
  updated into the native application (e.g. only update section sizes of a beam, not geometry).
